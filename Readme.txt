Clever Sandbox Guidelines

Sandbox
Clever provides partners the ability to create sandbox school districts (demo school accounts your team manages for development purposes).

Partners use sandbox school districts in order to 1) work with sample data as you build the integration and 2) understand the Clever interface that schools and districts see. 

These sandbox school districts are not intended for automated testing of the Clever API (use a tool like VCR https://github.com/vcr/vcr for that purpose).

In order to maintain the best experience for all Clever users we ask that partners adhere to the following guidelines around Sandbox districts.

Sandbox limits:
Max 5 districts
Max 25 schools (across all districts)

Naming conventions:
#DEMO <XXXXX> (e.g. #DEMO PartnerSandbox 1)
